generations:
  - name: "First Generation (DC)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The original Kia Rio was introduced as Kia's entry-level subcompact car, replacing the Pride/Avella in many markets. Available as a four-door sedan and five-door wagon (Rio Cinco in North America), it featured simple, functional styling. Powered by small-displacement four-cylinder engines, typically 1.3L and 1.5L units depending on the market, with modest power outputs focused on economy. The interior was basic and straightforward, with durable materials and minimal features. This generation established the Rio nameplate in Kia's global lineup, positioned as an affordable alternative to established subcompacts like the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, though with more basic engineering and features."

  - name: "Second Generation (JB)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The second-generation Rio featured more refined styling and improved engineering, available as a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. Built on a new platform shared with the Hyundai Accent, it offered better handling and ride quality compared to its predecessor. Engine options typically included 1.4L and 1.6L four-cylinders with improved efficiency and performance, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior saw enhancements in design, material quality, and feature content, though still positioned as a value-oriented offering. Safety features expanded to include standard front and available side airbags in many markets. This generation elevated the Rio's position from purely budget transportation to a more competitive subcompact offering."

  - name: "Third Generation (UB)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The third-generation Rio represented a significant leap forward in design, quality, and market positioning. Styled under the direction of Peter Schreyer, it featured more sophisticated, European-influenced design with the brand's signature 'tiger nose' grille. Available in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback body styles, it offered a more premium appearance than typical in the segment. Engine options evolved to include more efficient and refined units, typically 1.4L and 1.6L four-cylinders, with direct injection technology in some markets. The interior featured a more premium design with better materials and available features including a touchscreen infotainment system, rearview camera, and heated seats on higher trims. This generation successfully repositioned the Rio as a more stylish and feature-rich subcompact that could compete on more than just price."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (YB)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: null
    description: "The current Rio features more mature styling with clean lines and sophisticated detailing, maintaining Kia's 'tiger nose' grille in a more subtle interpretation. Available as a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback in most markets, though some regions only receive one body style. Built on Kia's global small-car platform with increased use of high-strength steel, it offers improved structural rigidity, safety, and refinement. Engine options vary by market but typically include efficient small-displacement units, with a 1.6L four-cylinder standard in North America, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. In some regions, mild-hybrid technology has been added to improve efficiency. The interior offers a more premium feel with better materials, improved design, and enhanced technology including an available 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone integration. Safety features have been significantly expanded, with advanced driver assistance systems like forward collision avoidance, lane keeping assist, and driver attention warning availableâ€”features once rare in the subcompact segment. A refresh in 2020 updated the styling subtly while adding more technology and the option of mild-hybrid powertrains in European markets. This generation positions the Rio as a refined, technology-rich option in the subcompact segment, offering near-compact levels of features and sophistication in a smaller package."
